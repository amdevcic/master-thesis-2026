\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conclusion}

Among all types of parametric curves, B\'ezier curves are the most widely used
as they are easy to implement and fast to compute. NURBS are the most flexible,
however they have historically been avoided for their complexity and unintuitive
design.

Through the use of vectorization it is possible to compute NURBS curves and
their operations at a speed which is suitable for real-time use and comparable
to B\'ezier curves. The library's simplicity and abstraction allows its users to
implement transformation methods in a way that is intuitive for their end-user
and appropriate for designing paths for autonomous mobile robots, as shown by
the example library made in Qt and the RViz plugin.
