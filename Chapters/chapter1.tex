\chapter{Mobile robot path design}
\label{chp:robotpathdesign}

In the past, AGV-s used physical rails, or magnetized or induction tracks,
placed in the environment to guide their movement. Modern mobile robots have
their paths defined in a controller application which sends commands to dictate
their movement. While driving, the robots use various sensors to verify their
velocity, position and orientation  and correct their path if necessary. Some
mobile robots require reflective stickers for navigation, though in other cases
no changes need to be made to the environment. In that case the robot uses a
combination of LIDAR sensors and computer vision to verify their position in
space and their speed.

\section{Path continuity}

Two mathematical concepts relevant to mobile robot navigation are geometric
continuity and parametric continuity of the robot's path. Parametric continuity
of the n-th degree, or $C^n$, is achieved when the n-th derivative of a function
exists and is continuous. Geometric continuity of the n-th degree, or $G^n$, is
a more relaxed form of parametric continuity, and is achieved if a function can
be reparametrized as a $C^n$ continuous function.
\cite{geometric_cont}

A $G^0$ continuous function is one where all of the points on the curve are
continuous, whereas a $G^1$ continuous function has a continuous tangent
direction as well as position. A function with $G^2$ continuity may be
appropriate for most uses. It has continuity in position, tangent direction and
curvature. It differs from a $C^2$ continuous curve in that its derivatives are
only continuous in direction, but a $C^2$ continuous curve would also have a
continuous magnitude in speed and acceleration. \cite{kokot2021arxiv}

For the navigation of multi-wheeled mobile robots it is important for the path
to have a continuous curvature derivative. This is only possible using curves
with $G^3$ continuity, as its definition requires the third derivative of the
curve, which will be discussed in a later chapter. Following a path with a
continuous curvature derivative means that the robot's steering angle is also
continuous. If this were not the case, the robot would need to stop and
reposition itself whenever the continuity was broken.

The curvature derivative is also important because it indicates how much and how
sharply the mobile robot must turn its steering wheels. A high curvature
derivative means that the robot needs to rotate its steering wheel a greater
angle in a shorter amount of time, which may put strain on the robot and be
dangerous for the people around it, especially if carrying heavy or unstable
cargo. In addition, robots have a physical limit as to how quickly they can turn
based on their size and architecture. \cite{mirko_phd}

A curve appropriate for mobile robot path design needs to have three attributes:
it must have geometric continuity of at least the third order, it must be easy
to manipulate to maximize the usage of available space, and it must be able to
be shaped in such a way to minimize the derivative of the curvature.
