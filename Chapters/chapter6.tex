\section{NURBS library applications}
The library was designed with mobile robot navigation in mind and as such it has
everything necessary to define and use 2-dimensional paths.

\section{Improvements and missing features}

The library was created for the purpose of designing top-down paths for vehicles
which move indoors, on flat floors, and as such works only in 2D space. As it
stands it can be used for any 2D application, including controlling robot
manipulators, e.g. in plotting or CNC machines.

One possible improvement to the library would be the ability to define NURBS
curves in any dimension, including 1D and from 3D onward. This could be achieved
using Eigen's class templates which can define the dimensions of matrices at
compile time, in this case the width of the control point matrix and the
\texttt{\_cached\_vbf} matrix. However, expanding the library to NURBS surfaces
in 2-dimensional \emph{parametric} space (parameters $t$ and $v$) would require
significant refactoring as all the methods rely on a scalar $t$ value. 

Three-dimensional splines can be used to define precise paths for industrial
robot manipulators.

One-dimensional splines have limited uses, however one possible application
would be to directly control the joints of a robot with precise control over its
timing and speed.

The library was written using the universally adopted \emph{C++17} standard,
meaning that it misses out on some features of modern C++. Additionally, during
development Eigen was updated to version \emph{5.0.0} and ROS2 has become the
standard in favor of ROS1, which is slowly being deprecated. Using modern
standards could result in better optimization and performance.

\section{Future work}

One possible way to extend the library for ease of use is to create Python
bindings to allow scripting with NURBS curves. This would prevent the user from
having to write and re-compile C++ code for simple tasks such as plotting. This
would also allow interoperability with other popular Python libraries such as
\emph{NumPy} and \emph{matplotlib}.
