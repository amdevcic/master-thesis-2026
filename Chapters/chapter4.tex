\chapter{Robot path visualisation}
\label{chp:robotpathvisual}

\section{Qt Framework}

For the purpose of testing the NURBS library and its functionalities, a program
was created using Qt and C++.

The actual visualization of NURBS paths was done using the QGraphicsView module.
This module implements various drawing functions including those for drawing
line segments and points.

The \texttt{polyline} method defined in the NURBS library creates a sequence of
line segments for the express purpose of quick and simple visualization. 

\section{RViz}

For testing in a simulation environment a plugin was created for the RViz tool
often used for visualization of robots.
