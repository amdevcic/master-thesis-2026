    Abstract= {Parametric spline curves are typically constructed so that the first <i>n</i> parametric derivatives agree where the curve segments abut. This type of continuity condition has become known as <i>C^n</i> or <i>n</i>th order parametric continuity. We show that the use of parametric continuity disallows many parametrizations which generate geometrically smooth curves.  <p>  We define <i>n</i>th order geometric continuity (<i>G^n</i>), develop constraint equations that are necessary and sufficient for geometric continuity of curves, and show that geometric continuity is a relaxed form of parametric continuity. <i>G^n</i> continuity provides for the introduction of <i>n</i> quantities known as shape parameters which can be made available to a designer in a computer aided design environment to modify the shape of curves without moving control vertices.  Several applications of the theory are discussed, along with topics of future research.},
